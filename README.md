# BianorTask

The project is still having an issue with the container images, but unfortunetly I ran out of time to fix it. So to start it:

- The requirements.txt have to be inslalled (on a virtual envirement of your choise)
- The database can be created running the db_init.sh script
- Server is started with uvicorn main:app
