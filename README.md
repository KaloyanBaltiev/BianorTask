The project is still having an issue with the container images, but unfortunetly I ran out of time to fix it. So to start it:

<br 1. The requirements.txt have to be inslalled (on a virtual envirement of your choise) />
2. The database can be created running the db_init.sh script
3. Server is started with uvicorn main:app
